Selenium Automation Mini Project Implementation Guidelines

As part of your mini project, you need to implement following in the project

Implement reusable methods separately to improve more readability.
Multibrowser execution- Handle at least two browsers (Firefox and IE/Chrome). Optional - desired capabilities/driver setup
Data driven concept - Input data should be imported from an external excel sheet (Ex: using Apache PoI libraries in case of Java) or Properties file or flat file
Handle exceptions with exception handling & error messages
Use relative path
Used ID or Name locator instead of XPATH
Coding standard should be followed, which includes variable, object naming convention, script headers & comments
All scripts / business components/Test results should be available in their respective folders
Functions should have header, comments wherever applicable to improve readability and maintainability
Handle page synchronization issues using industry standard best practices. UseTimeout instead of Sleep statement wherever applicable.
Validation messages should be logged into the Test Results or Console output
